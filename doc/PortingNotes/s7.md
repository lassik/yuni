s7 support (prototype)
======================

* [Official document](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/snd/s7.html)

s7 is an embedded Scheme interpreter implemented in a C source and several 
Scheme libraries.

Yuni's s7 support implemented using [Generic][] runtime.

Limitation
----------

See [Generic][] for generic runtime limitations.

Although s7 provides its own R7RS support, Yuni uses its own R7RS implementation
to avoid C function dependencies. The implementation is still incomplate.

Yuni runtime requires `stuff.scm` which is distributed with s7 for
`define-class`.

`(yuni core)` library is not supported (yet).

s7yuni
------

[Yunibase][] builds a specially crafted binary called `s7yuni` that 
automatically load [Generic][] runtime to run Yuni's R6RS-lite formatted 
Scheme programs and libraries directly.
